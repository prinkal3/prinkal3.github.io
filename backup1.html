framework to encourage consistency across internal tools. 
Before Bootstrap, various libraries were used for interface
development, which led to inconsistencies and a high 
maintenance burden. According to Twitter developer Mark Otto:<mark>
"A super small group of developers and I got together to 
design and build a new internal tool and saw an opportunity
to do something more. Through that process, we saw ourselves 
build something much more substantial than another internal 
tool. Months later, we ended up with an early version of 
Bootstrap as a way to document and share common design patterns 
and assets within the company."</mark></pre></blockquote>

JSON, sometimes JavaScript Object Notation), is an open 
standard format that uses human-readable text to transmit 
data objects consisting of attributeâ€“value pairs. It is the

Although originally derived from the JavaScript scripting 
language, JSON is a language-independent data format. Code for
parsing and generating JSON data is readily available in 
many programming languages.
The JSON format was originally specified by <mark>Douglas Crockford</mark> 
It is currently described by two competing standards, 
RFC 7159 and ECMA-404. The ECMA standard is minimal, describing
only the allowed grammar syntax, whereas the RFC also provides 
some semantic and security considerations.The official 
Internet media type for JSON is application/json.

Python is a widely used general-purpose, high-level programming
language.Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability, and 
its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines

or Java.The language provides constructs intended to enable 
clear programs on both a small and large scale.Python 
supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-
oriented, imperative and functional programming or 
procedural styles. It features a dynamic type system and 
automatic memory management and has a large and 
comprehensive standard library.
Python interpreters are available for installation on 
many operating systems, allowing Python code execution 
on a wide variety of systems. Using third-party tools, 
such as Py2exe or Pyinstaller,Python code can be packaged 
into stand-alone executable programs for some of the most 
popular operating systems, allowing the distribution
